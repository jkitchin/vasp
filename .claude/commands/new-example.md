Create a new example for the VASP-ASE project.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (example name/topic)

Follow this workflow:

1. Ask the user for:
   - Example topic (if not provided in $ARGUMENTS)
   - Difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
   - Key concepts to cover
   - Estimated runtime

2. Determine the next example number by listing existing examples

3. Create the directory structure:
   - examples/{number}_{topic}/
   - examples/{number}_{topic}/run.py
   - examples/{number}_{topic}/README.md

4. Generate run.py following the pattern of existing examples:
   - Clear section headers with print statements
   - Progressive parts building on each other
   - Comments explaining key concepts
   - Summary at the end

5. Generate README.md with:
   - Key concepts section
   - VASP parameters table
   - Physical background
   - Expected output
   - Tips section

6. Add the Claude-generated header to the tutorial markdown:
   ```markdown
   ```{admonition} ❌ ✅ Claude Code Generated
   :class: warning
   This tutorial was generated by Claude Code and has not yet been human-verified. Remove the ❌ after review.
   ```
   ```

7. Update docs/_toc.yml and examples/README.md

8. Create the corresponding docs/tutorials/{number}_{topic}.md file
